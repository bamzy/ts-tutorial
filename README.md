# TypeScript-tutorial

This is my hands-on TS coding by using VS Code.

* TypeScript is a javascript superset meaning it adds stuff to JS.
* But TS cannot be exucted by JS compilers like the one in your browser!
* Even Node.js cannot excutes TS.
* TS can be compiled to JS code and used, but writing in TS means a more cleaner and stable code.
* TS compiler understands more than just JS features. But these improvements should always be convertible to JS capabilities.

## Why TS?
1- less error

2- compile time error/validations/sanitize

3- explicit types and a push toward static typed js language 

## Install:
1- npm install -g typescript
## Compile:
1- tsc [filename]

## TypeScript Syllabus:

1- Types become essintial here.

2- IDE integration is a real blessing.

3- We can use next-gen JS features that are then compiled down for older browser compatibility.

4- Non-javascript features like **Classes**, **Interfaces** and **Generics** are also added to JS via TS.

5- Meta-programming features like **Decorators**, **Namespaces**, **Modules** 

6- Webpack

7- Rich configuration options.

8- Modern tooling is even usefull if you are not using other TS features.
