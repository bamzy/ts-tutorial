# ts-tutorial

This is my hands on TS with some practicin with VS Code.

* TypeScript is a javascript superset meaning it adds stuff to JS.
* But TS cannot be exucted by JS compilers like the one in your browser!
* Even Node.js cannot excutes TS.
* TS can be compiled to JS code and used, but writing in TS means a more cleaner and stable code.
* TS compiler understands more than just JS features. But these improvements should always be convertible to JS capabilities.

## Why TS?
1- less error
2- compile time error/validations/sanitize
3- explicit types and a push toward static type 

## Install:
1- npm install -g typescript
## Compile:
1- tsc [filename]
